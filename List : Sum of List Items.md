# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = sum(numbers)
print("The sum of list items is:", total)


## Output
The sum of list items is: 150

## Result
The program successfully calculates the sum of all elements in a list using Pythonâ€™s built-in sum() function.
